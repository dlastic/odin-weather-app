# Weather App

This is a **Weather App** built as part of the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. It allows users to enter a location and fetches the current weather conditions from an external API. The app displays temperature, conditions, wind speed, humidity, and feels-like temperature dynamically.

This project emphasizes **fetch API usage**, asynchronous JavaScript with async/await, and DOM manipulation.

Try the app [here](https://dlastic.github.io/odin-weather-app/).

## Features

- **Weather Data Fetching**: Retrieves current weather data from the Visual Crossing Weather API.
- **Dynamic UI Updates**: Displays weather details dynamically below the search form.
- **Form Handling**: Prevents default form submission and handles searches asynchronously.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully shows a message if data is unavailable or fetching fails.
